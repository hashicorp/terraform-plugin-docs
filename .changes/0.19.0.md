## 0.19.0 (April 15, 2024)

BREAKING CHANGES:

* generate: the `plainmarkdown` function now removes all markdown elements/formatting to render the output as plain text ([#332](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/issues/332))
* schemamd: The `schemamd` package has moved to `internal/schemamd` and can no longer be imported ([#354](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/issues/354))

FEATURES:

* validate: Added support for Provider-defined Function documentation to all checks ([#341](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/issues/341))
* validate: Added `InvalidDirectoriesCheck` which checks for valid provider documentation folder structure ([#341](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/issues/341))
* validate: Added `MixedDirectoriesCheck` which throws an error if both legacy documentation and registry documentation are found ([#341](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/issues/341))
* validate: Added `NumberOfFilesCheck` which checks the number of provider documentation files against the registry limit ([#341](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/issues/341))

ENHANCEMENTS:

* migrate: Added `--provider-name` flag to override the default provider name when any file names that contain provider name prefixes are removed during migration ([#349](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/issues/349))

BUG FIXES:

* migrate: use relative paths (from provider directory) instead of absolute paths for migrated code templates ([#330](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/issues/330))
* migrate: fixed a bug where documentation files with provider name prefixes were migrated to templates directory as-is, causing `generate` to create duplicate templates ([#349](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/issues/349))
* generate: fixed a bug where incorrect attribute titles were being generated for certain nested schemas ([#350](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/issues/350))
