# Time Provider

The time provider is used to interact with time-based resources. The provider itself has no configuration options.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Resource "Triggers"

Certain time resources, only perform actions during specific lifecycle actions:

- `time_offset`: Saves base timestamp into Terraform state only when created.
- `time_sleep`: Sleeps when created and/or destroyed.
- `time_static`: Saves base timestamp into Terraform state only when created.

These resources provide an optional map argument called `triggers` that can be populated with arbitrary key/value pairs. When the keys or values of this argument are updated, Terraform will re-perform the desired action, such as updating the base timestamp or sleeping again.

For example:

```hcl
resource "time_static" "ami_update" {
  triggers = {
    # Save the time each switch of an AMI id
    ami_id = data.aws_ami.example.id
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "server" {
  # Read the AMI id "through" the time_static resource to ensure that
  # both will change together.
  ami = time_static.ami_update.triggers.ami_id

  tags = {
    AmiUpdateTime = time_static.ami_update.rfc3339
  }

  # ... (other aws_instance arguments) ...
}
```

`triggers` are *not* treated as sensitive attributes; a value used for `triggers` will be displayed in Terraform UI output as plaintext.

To force a these actions to reoccur without updating `triggers`, the [`terraform taint` command](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/taint.html) can be used to produce the action on the next run.

  Manages a offset time resource.

# Resource: time_offset

Manages an offset time resource, which keeps an UTC timestamp stored in the Terraform state that is offset from a locally sourced base timestamp. This prevents perpetual differences caused by using the [`timestamp()` function](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions/timestamp.html).

-> Further manipulation of incoming or outgoing values can be accomplished with the [`formatdate()` function](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions/formatdate.html) and the [`timeadd()` function](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions/timeadd.html).

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```hcl
resource "time_offset" "example" {
  offset_days = 7
}

output "one_week_from_now" {
  value = time_offset.example.rfc3339
}
```

### Triggers Usage

```hcl
resource "time_offset" "ami_update" {
  triggers = {
    # Save the time each switch of an AMI id
    ami_id = data.aws_ami.example.id
  }

  offset_days = 7
}

resource "aws_instance" "server" {
  # Read the AMI id "through" the time_offset resource to ensure that
  # both will change together.
  ami = time_offset.ami_update.triggers.ami_id

  tags = {
    ExpirationTime = time_offset.ami_update.rfc3339
  }

  # ... (other aws_instance arguments) ...
}
```

## Argument Reference

  Manages a rotating time resource.

# Resource: time_rotating

Manages a rotating time resource, which keeps a rotating UTC timestamp stored in the Terraform state and proposes resource recreation when the locally sourced current time is beyond the rotation time. This rotation only occurs when Terraform is executed, meaning there will be drift between the rotation timestamp and actual rotation. The new rotation timestamp offset includes this drift. This prevents perpetual differences caused by using the [`timestamp()` function](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions/timestamp.html) by only forcing a new value on the set cadence.

-> Further manipulation of incoming or outgoing values can be accomplished with the [`formatdate()` function](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions/formatdate.html) and the [`timeadd()` function](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions/timeadd.html).

## Example Usage

This example configuration will rotate (destroy/create) the resource every 30 days.

```hcl
resource "time_rotating" "example" {
  rotation_days = 30
}
```

## Argument Reference

~> **NOTE:** At least one of the `rotation_` arguments must be configured.

The following arguments are optional:

* `rfc3339` - (Optional) Configure the base timestamp with an UTC [RFC3339 time string](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.8) (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`). Defaults to the current time.
* `rotation_days` - (Optional) Number of days to add to the base timestamp to configure the rotation timestamp. When the current time has passed the rotation timestamp, the resource will trigger recreation. Conflicts with other `rotation_` arguments.
* `rotation_hours` - (Optional) Number of hours to add to the base timestamp to configure the rotation timestamp. When the current time has passed the rotation timestamp, the resource will trigger recreation. Conflicts with other `rotation_` arguments.
* `rotation_minutes` - (Optional) Number of minutes to add to the base timestamp to configure the rotation timestamp. When the current time has passed the rotation timestamp, the resource will trigger recreation. Conflicts with other `rotation_` arguments.
* `rotation_months` - (Optional) Number of months to add to the base timestamp to configure the rotation timestamp. When the current time has passed the rotation timestamp, the resource will trigger recreation. Conflicts with other `rotation_` arguments.
* `rotation_rfc3339` - (Optional) Configure the rotation timestamp with an UTC [RFC3339 time string](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.8) (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`). When the current time has passed the rotation timestamp, the resource will trigger recreation. Conflicts with other `rotation_` arguments.
* `rotation_years` - (Optional) Number of years to add to the base timestamp to configure the rotation timestamp. When the current time has passed the rotation timestamp, the resource will trigger recreation. Conflicts with other `rotation_` arguments.
* `triggers` - (Optional) Arbitrary map of values that, when changed, will trigger a new base timestamp value to be saved. These conditions recreate the resource in addition to other rotation arguments. See [the main provider documentation](../index.html) for more information.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `day` - Number day of timestamp.
* `hour` - Number hour of timestamp.
* `id` - UTC RFC3339 format of the base timestamp, e.g. `2020-02-12T06:36:13Z`.
* `minute` - Number minute of timestamp.
* `month` - Number month of timestamp.
* `second` - Number second of timestamp.
* `unix` - Number of seconds since epoch time, e.g. `1581489373`.
* `year` - Number year of timestamp.

## Import

This resource can be imported using the base UTC RFC3339 value and rotation years, months, days, hours, and minutes, separated by commas (`,`), e.g. for 30 days

```console
$ terraform import time_rotation.example 2020-02-12T06:36:13Z,0,0,30,0,0
```

Otherwise, to import with the rotation RFC3339 value, the base UTC RFC3339 value and rotation UTC RFC3339 value, separated by commas (`,`), e.g.

```console
$ terraform import time_rotation.example 2020-02-12T06:36:13Z,2020-02-13T06:36:13Z
```

The `triggers` argument cannot be imported.

layout: "time"
page_title: "Time: time_sleep"
description: |-
  Manages a static time resource.
---

# Resource: time_sleep

Manages a resource that delays creation and/or destruction, typically for further resources. This prevents cross-platform compatibility and destroy-time issues with using the [`local-exec` provisioner](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/local-exec.html).

-> In many cases, this resource should be considered a workaround for issues that should be reported and handled in downstream Terraform Provider logic. Downstream resources can usually introduce or adjust retries in their code to handle time delay issues for all Terraform configurations or upstream resources can be improved to better wait for a resource to be fully ready and available.

## Example Usage

### Delay Create Usage

```hcl
# This resource will destroy (potentially immediately) after null_resource.next
resource "null_resource" "previous" {}

resource "time_sleep" "wait_30_seconds" {
  depends_on = [null_resource.previous]

  create_duration = "30s"
}

# This resource will create (at least) 30 seconds after null_resource.previous
resource "null_resource" "next" {
  depends_on = [time_sleep.wait_30_seconds]
}
```

### Delay Destroy Usage

```hcl
# This resource will destroy (at least) 30 seconds after null_resource.next
resource "null_resource" "previous" {}

resource "time_sleep" "wait_30_seconds" {
  depends_on = [null_resource.previous]

  destroy_duration = "30s"
}

# This resource will create (potentially immediately) after null_resource.previous
resource "null_resource" "next" {
  depends_on = [time_sleep.wait_30_seconds]
}
```

### Triggers Usage

```hcl
resource "aws_ram_resource_association" "example" {
  resource_arn       = aws_subnet.example.arn
  resource_share_arn = aws_ram_resource_share.example.arn
}

# AWS resources shared via Resource Access Manager can take a few seconds to
# propagate across AWS accounts after RAM returns a successful association.
resource "time_sleep" "ram_resource_propagation" {
  create_duration = "60s"

  triggers = {
    # This sets up a proper dependency on the RAM association
    subnet_arn = aws_ram_resource_association.example.resource_arn
    subnet_id  = aws_subnet.example.id
  }
}

resource "aws_db_subnet_group" "example" {
  name = "example"

  # Read the Subnet identifier "through" the time_sleep resource to ensure a
  # proper dependency and that both will change together.
  subnet_ids = [time_sleep.ram_resource_propagation.triggers["subnet_id"]]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are optional:

* `create_duration` - (Optional) [Time duration][1] to delay resource creation. For example, `30s` for 30 seconds or `5m` for 5 minutes. Updating this value by itself will not trigger a delay.
* `destroy_duration` - (Optional) [Time duration][1] to delay resource destroy. For example, `30s` for 30 seconds or `5m` for 5 minutes. Updating this value by itself will not trigger a delay. This value or any updates to it must be successfully applied into the Terraform state before destroying this resource to take effect.
* `triggers` - (Optional) Arbitrary map of values that, when changed, will run any creation or destroy delays again. See [the main provider documentation](../index.html) for more information.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - UTC RFC3339 timestamp of the creation or import, e.g. `2020-02-12T06:36:13Z`.

## Import

This resource can be imported with the `create_duration` and `destroy_duration`, separated by a comma (`,`).

e.g. For 30 seconds create duration with no destroy duration:

```console
$ terraform import time_sleep.example 30s,
```

e.g. For 30 seconds destroy duration with no create duration:

```console
$ terraform import time_sleep.example ,30s
```

The `triggers` argument cannot be imported.

resource "aws_instance" "server" {
  # Read the AMI id "through" the time_static resource to ensure that
  # both will change together.
  ami = time_static.ami_update.triggers.ami_id

  tags = {
    AmiUpdateTime = time_static.ami_update.rfc3339
  }

  # ... (other aws_instance arguments) ...
}
